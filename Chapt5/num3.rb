# 3. Write a program to calculate compounded interest using a while loop. The user
# inputs the amount deposited, the interest rate (as a percentage) per period, and the
# number of periods the deposit accumulates interest. Compound interest means that
# every period, your new balance is calculated using the last periodâ€™s balance times
# the interest rate.
